Final Capstone Step 2: Project Proposal:

I have chosen the first choice of my ideas to do a project proposal on.  My initial idea was this:

A website for users to find their favorite cocktails and randomly select ones if they are unsure of what they would like.  Users will have a profile that lets them save drink favorites and create new creations of their own.

I wanted to attempt this application using a React JS and Node tech stack.  I have had better luck deploying React projects and I like the UI/UX feel better when creating a React app.  My goal is to focus more on the backend of this app so that a user can create a profile and have their own personal page where users can list their favorite cocktails.

Things I would like on the profile would be: the user’s favorite drinks (with possible reviews) and the ability to create drinks of their own and post it to their favorites (might make this an extra feature).  Also, I want the user to be able to search for random drinks if they are indecisive. The demographic will be users interested in finding out more about alcoholic beverages and having a space where they can save their favorites for reference, and create their own to share or have as a reference.

The data will most likely come from an API.  I had one in mind that had lots of information about cocktails.  It is called The CocktailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).  It has pretty much all the data needed for the site.  The API data contains: The drink name with photo, ingredients (with pics), amount of each ingredient to add, quick instructions for how to make each beverage, and what glass it is served in.  If I do encounter issues with this API, I may create my own API with very similar data points.

I want my database schema to have 2 tables: one for user logins (username, password) and the other for the user's favorite cocktail selection.  Since this application is meant to be accessed by users who are over the age of 21, I will try to come up with a feature that requires users to enter their birthday to register and view the site.  The Home page will most likely be a welcome page with a NavBar that leads to “search-cocktail”, “random-cocktail”, “my-favorites”, and an “About-Us”.
